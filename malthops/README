README: instructions on how to use code
---------------------------------------

This assumes you have the following installed
- miriad
- pdl
- pgplot.pm and f77.pm
- pgplot
- sherpa (ciao 4.2)
- latex

and probably some other dependencies I'm unaware of

------------------------------------------------------------
Installation and Setup
--------------

* CIAO 4.2
http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/download/
The "Quick Installation" should be fine. I installed in /usr/local
Under tcsh

    source /usr/local/ciao-4.2/bin/ciao.csh

* pgplot5
This is available through apt-get on Ubuntu

===== This step no longer useful ====

add
PGPLOT_DIR=/usr/lib/pgplot5

to your startup file. PGPLOT5 will work okay without this line, except
for not displaying any text on your images.

=====================================

* pdl (Perl Data Language)
This is available through apt-get on Ubuntu

I also had to install pgplot.pm (and its prereq f77.pm). These I had
to install "by-hand" following the INSTALL instructions in the
downloaded file.

* pgplot.pm  -- http://search.cpan.org/~kgb/PGPLOT/
* f77.pm -- http://search.cpan.org/~kgb/ExtUtils-F77-1.16/F77.pm

I had to define a new environment variable pointing to the install
location. Depending on where you install this may not be necessary.

setenv PERL5LIB "INSTALLDIR/lib/perl/5.8.8:INSTALLDIR/share/perl/5.8.8"

MIRIAD
http://www.astro.umd.edu/~teuben/miriad/intro.html
-------
It is known to work out of the box on most Linux and MacOSX machines..
On the simplest level it can be done with the following two commands:

  curlftp://ftp.astro.umd.edu/progs/bima/miriad.tar.gz  | tar zxf -

miriad/install/install.miriad

after which you must do

  source /usr/local/miriad/miriad_start.csh

to add the appropriate variables to your path.

------------------------------------------------------------
Change paths
---------------

Several paths are hard-coded. At a minimum you need to change lines
15/16 of run_batch.pl

$nh3_11_dir = ...
$nh3_22_dir = ...
to point to your data files.

Lines 19-26 in nh3_fit_sherpa_out_hops.pl need to be configured to
point to the PDL install location (default often okay).

Do NOT bother to modify paths sherpa_fits.py, this file is generated
by fit_sherpa_batch_tl_hops.pl. If you need to change the paths
defined, do it here. Most of these are standard locations for a python
2.5 install.

------------------------------------------------------------
Run the fitting
---------------

The whole procedure is wrapped up in "run_batch.pl"

"run_batch.pl":
	
	- takes two input directories, one for each of NH3(1,1) and (2,2)

	- reads in all the fits files in these two directories 

	- checks there is both an image file and a fits file for both
          11 and 22 

	- checks the names match between 11 and 22

	- outputs some text files: "stats.txt", "fits.tex",
          "batch.txt". not sure how useful the first file actually
          is. "fits.tex" is used by "nh3_fit_sherpa_out_hops.pl" to
          output the fits values to create a latex table. "batch.txt"
          is the file used as input to the sherpa fitting.

	- spectrally smooths the data 

	- runs the sherpa fitting with the command
          "./fit_sherpa_batch_tl_hops.pl batch.txt". Creates a whole
          bunch of files "*ampl.fits", "*fwhm.fits", "*pos.fits",
          "*resid.fits"

	- runs the nh3 analysis program on the output from the sherpa
          fitting.


"./fit_sherpa_batch_tl_hops.pl <INFILE>"
    
        - calls sherpa to do the fitting

	- both the input files and the fitting parameters are read in
          from <INFILE>. 

"nh3_fit_sherpa_out_hops.pl ": 

        - this program takes 8 command-line inputs.

	- the output files from sherpa are read in to PDL and the
          physical values are derived and spatial maps created.
